# Description 
With the current version, GPFniCS can simulate fracture failure in one and two-dimensional linear elastic isotropic materials subject to monotonic loading. It can compute mode I, mode II, and mixed mode fractures. GPFniCS is validated for various cases and the codes for the validated cases are provided. It can model brittle and quasi-brittle fractures with general types of softening like linear, exponential, and hyperbolic. GPFniCS can be further extended to three-dimensional geometries, including the effect of other physics, different types of loading like fatigue, residual stresses, and material damaging phenomena.

# Libraries used
GPFniCS is developed in the Python 3.8.10 environment. This code is based on the FEniCS and NumPy libraries available on these https://fenicsproject.org/download/ and https://numpy.org/install/, respectively. There installtion process is provided below. For the purpose of post-processing, open-source software ParaView is used for contour plotting, while line plots are generated via Python 3.8.10. The architecture and functionality of the GPFniCS are explained in the article. 

# Installation
FEniCS installation:

        sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
	
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fenics-packages/fenics
	
        sudo apt-get update
	
        sudo apt-get install fenics

more details can be found at the https://fenicsproject.org/download/archive/

Other external libraries used in the codes are: numpy and shapely.
Which can be install using following commands.

Numpy:

        pip install numpy

# Inputs and Outputs
Inputs: Material Data, discretized geometry in .xml format. Boundary conditions.
Outputs: Contour plots in .pvd format can be imported into ParaView. Load and displacement values are recorded in a text file. The Python script is used to produce the plots for load and displacement plots.
